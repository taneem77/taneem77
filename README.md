## About Me
I’m a second-year Computer Science student at **PES University** with a strong foundation in **C, Data Structures, and problem-solving**.  
I enjoy breaking down complex problems, writing efficient code, and building systems with a clear understanding of how things work under the hood.

I’m currently strengthening my core CS knowledge through:
- Data Structures and Algorithms  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Database Management Systems  
- Operating Systems  
- Computer Networks  

My primary interests lie in **Software Development** and **Backend Engineering**, and I’m gradually exploring **AI/ML** alongside my coursework.
